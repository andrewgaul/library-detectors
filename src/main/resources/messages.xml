    APIs marked with the &#64;Beta annotation at the class or method level are subject to change.
    They can be modified in any way, or even removed, in any major release. If your code is
    a library itself (i.e. it is used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you
    should not use beta APIs, unless you repackage them (e.g. using ProGuard).
